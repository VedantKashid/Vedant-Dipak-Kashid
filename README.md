“A cybersecurity student passionate about SOC operations, network security, Linux, and practical security labs. I build security tools, automate tasks with Python/Bash, and explore offensive and defensive security techniques.” 

##  About Me  
I’m a Cybersecurity-enthusiast and student, building practical tools and scripts to explore security, networking, and steganography.  
I enjoy turning ideas into code — whether it's a mini Security Operations Center (SOC) lab, image steganography experiments, or other security-related projects.  
I’m open to internships, collaborative projects, and opportunities to learn and contribute.  

##  What I’m good at / Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python,Java,Html,CSS,JavaScript.  
- **Security & Networking Tools:** Custom SOC lab scripts, steganography, network scanning/monitoring (as per my projects)  
- **Other Skills:** Documentation, clear code organization, problem-solving mindset, quick learning, collaborative mindset  

## 💡 What I’m interested in / Learning  
- Deepening knowledge of cybersecurity, penetration testing, network security  
- Building more real-world tools / automation for security / forensics / monitoring  
- Contributing to open-source security or networking projects  

## 📂 Featured Projects  
Here are a few projects I’m proud of — check them out to see what I build and how I code:

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **SOC-MINI-LAB** | A compact security-operations-style lab / setup — an attempt to simulate SOC tools and workflows. |
| **Image-Stegnography** | Scripts/tools for hiding data within images — demonstrating understanding of steganography and scripting. |
